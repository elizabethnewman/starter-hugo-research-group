Here is some text that I want to write.


But I also want to show some code.

	If we indent, we see something cool.

## Let's Write Some Math!

We can add $x + 2$, or solve $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$, or write in $E\lambda\lambda{\acute{\alpha}}\delta\alpha$. 

We can also write math in its own line.

\begin{equation}
Ax = \lambda x
\end{equation}
